# Database Connection Pool Optimization

## Problem Identified

From Vercel function logs, we identified severe connection pool exhaustion:
- Connection pool limited to only 5 connections
- Requests timing out with: "Timed out fetching a new connection from the connection pool"
- Cascade failures once pool saturated
- 503 Service Unavailable errors affecting all database operations

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Increased Connection Pool Size
- **Before**: 5 connections (Prisma default)
- **After**: 25 connections
- **Location**: `/lib/prisma.ts`

```typescript
url.searchParams.set('connection_limit', '25'); // Increased from default 5
url.searchParams.set('pool_timeout', '20'); // Increased from default 10
```

### 2. Connection Pool Monitoring
- Created `/lib/db-connection-monitor.ts` for real-time pool health tracking
- Monitors active/idle connections and pool utilization
- Provides recommendations when pool is unhealthy
- Logs warnings when utilization exceeds 80%

### 3. Enhanced Database Configuration
- **pgbouncer mode**: Better connection pooling for serverless
- **Statement timeout**: 30 seconds to prevent long-running queries
- **Pool timeout**: 20 seconds (up from 10) for connection acquisition

### 4. Diagnostic Endpoint
- Added `/api/diagnostic/connection-pool` for monitoring
- Shows current pool metrics, connection details, and recommendations
- Requires admin authentication

## Configuration Details

The optimized connection string includes:
```
?connection_limit=25&pool_timeout=20&pgbouncer=true&statement_timeout=30000
```

## Benefits

1. **5x more connections**: Handles higher concurrent load
2. **Better timeout handling**: 2x longer pool timeout prevents premature failures
3. **Query protection**: Statement timeout prevents runaway queries
4. **Monitoring**: Real-time visibility into pool health
5. **Proactive warnings**: Alerts before pool saturation

## Monitoring

Check pool health:
```bash
curl https://www.vocahire.com/api/diagnostic/connection-pool
```

Key metrics to watch:
- **Utilization**: Should stay below 80%
- **Active connections**: Should not consistently hit pool limit
- **Idle connections**: Should always have some available

## Next Steps

1. Monitor production metrics after deployment
2. Adjust pool size based on actual usage patterns
3. Consider implementing connection pooling at application level
4. Set up alerts for pool saturation events
