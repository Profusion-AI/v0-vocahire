# CLAUDE.md - VocaHire Development Guide

**Last Updated**: May 28, 2025 1:30 PM CST  
**Target Launch**: June 1, 2025 (Public Beta) üéØ

## üéØ MVP Focus: Real-Time AI Conversations

**Core Value Proposition**: VocaHire introduces users to full-duplex, natural conversations with AI - a completely new experience beyond text-based chatbots. The magic is in the real-time voice interaction, not in recording playback.

## üéâ Current Status

**Overall Status**: ‚úÖ SUCCESSFULLY DEPLOYED TO CLOUD RUN! üöÄ

### Production URLs
- **Cloud Run**: https://v0-vocahire-727828254616.us-central1.run.app/
- **Custom Domain**: https://vocahire.com (DNS propagating, SSL pending)

### What's Working
1. **‚úÖ Authentication** - Clerk integration fully functional
2. **‚úÖ Real-time AI Conversations** - Google AI Live API integrated
3. **‚úÖ Payment System** - Stripe ready for credit purchases
4. **‚úÖ Database** - Transcripts and feedback stored reliably
5. **‚úÖ Deployment** - Cloud Run with automated CI/CD

### MVP Decisions
- **No Audio Recording Storage** - Focus on live conversation experience
- **No WebRTC Peer-to-Peer** - Using Server-Sent Events (SSE) with Google AI
- **No Complex Features** - Just amazing conversations and feedback

## üí° Key Principles

- **Conversation Magic First**: The "wow" moment is talking naturally with AI
- **Bootstrap-Friendly**: Minimal infrastructure, maximum user value
- **Security & Privacy**: No audio recordings stored, just transcripts
- **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful degradation for all failures
- **Ship Fast, Learn Fast**: MVP by June 1, iterate based on feedback

## üèóÔ∏è Current Architecture

### Simplified Architecture (What Actually Exists)

```
Browser ‚Üí HTTP/SSE ‚Üí Next.js API ‚Üí Google AI Live API
                         ‚Üì
                    Database (Transcripts & Feedback)
```

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.2.3 (App Router)
- **Authentication**: Clerk
- **Payments**: Stripe
- **AI**: Google AI Live API (Gemini 2.5)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Prisma
- **Deployment**: Google Cloud Run
- **CI/CD**: Cloud Build (GitHub trigger)

## üìã Recent Progress

### May 28, 2025 - Afternoon Success (1:30 PM CST)

#### üéâ Latest Successful Deployment
- **Build ID**: dffa7516-9b1e-4998-b4fb-be83a554206a
- **Status**: ‚úÖ SUCCESS
- **Deployment Time**: ~7.5 minutes
- **Revision**: v0-vocahire-00013-flq

#### Key Fixes That Enabled Success
1. **Google AI API Key** - Properly configured in Secret Manager
2. **Cloud Run Environment** - Added GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY via `--update-secrets`
3. **Reverted to Google AI Studio** - Removed Vertex AI complexity for MVP
4. **Removed Unused Files** - Eliminated vertex-ai-live-client.ts build errors

#### Current Configuration
- **Authentication**: Google AI Studio with API key (temporary for MVP)
- **Environment Variables**:
  - `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY` - From Secret Manager
  - `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` - For logging/monitoring
  - `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION` - us-central1
- **Health Check**: ‚úÖ Working at `/api/health`
- **Known Issue**: `/api/interview-v2/health` returns 404 (non-critical)

### May 28, 2025 - Morning Decisions (11:00 AM CST)

#### Vertex AI vs Google AI Studio Analysis
1. **Discovery**: Vertex AI has Live API (Preview) but not suitable for MVP
2. **Decision**: Keep Google AI Studio for real-time audio
3. **Rationale**: 
   - Working solution in place
   - 3-day timeline too tight for migration
   - Preview status = risk
   - No clear UX benefit for MVP
4. **Future**: Created POST_MVP_VERTEX_AI_MIGRATION_BLUEPRINT.md

### May 28, 2025 - Morning Deployment Success (8:00 AM CST)

#### Key Decisions Made
1. **Removed Google Cloud Storage** - Not needed for MVP
2. **Removed WebRTC Components** - Using SSE instead
3. **Simplified Architecture** - Focus on what matters
4. **Fixed ESLint Issues** - Pragmatic approach to warnings

#### What We Learned
- ESLint strict mode was blocking builds unnecessarily
- File storage adds complexity without MVP value
- The magic is in the conversation, not the infrastructure

### May 28, 2025 - Morning Deployment Success (8:00 AM CST)

#### Critical Fixes That Enabled Deployment
1. **TypeScript Compilation** - Fixed all strict mode errors
2. **Build Configuration** - Proper environment variable handling
3. **Authentication** - Fixed redirect URLs for Cloud Run
4. **Dependencies** - Removed Vercel-specific code

- A foundation to build upon
- A way to help job seekers prepare

### Known Limitations
- Direct push to main (PR workflow coming post-MVP)
- Basic error handling (will improve based on user feedback)

## ü§ù Team Notes

**Current Focus**: Getting to a stable, delightful MVP that showcases the core value - natural AI conversations for interview practice.

**Philosophy**: Ship fast, learn from users, iterate quickly. The infrastructure can grow with the business.

**Remember**: We succeeded at 8 AM this morning. Everything since then has been optimization. Don't let perfect be the enemy of good.
