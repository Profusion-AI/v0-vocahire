This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Working MVP Configuration (May 2025)

**After 100+ build attempts, the following configuration is PROVEN TO WORK. DO NOT MODIFY these settings without thorough testing.**

### Essential Working Components:
1. **Model**: `gpt-4o-mini-realtime-preview` (exact string required)
2. **API Headers**: `'OpenAI-Beta': 'realtime=v1'` (note the =v1 format)
3. **Session Creation**: NO `input_audio_transcription` parameter in the request body
4. **Credit Deduction**: MUST be synchronous (await the database update)
5. **Auto-Start Protection**: Use `hasAttemptedStart` ref to prevent loops
6. **WebRTC Exchange**: Use ephemeral token from session, NOT the API key

### Files That Must Not Be Modified Without Testing:
- `/app/api/realtime-session/route.ts` - Session creation logic
- `/app/api/webrtc-exchange/route.ts` - SDP exchange logic
- `/hooks/useRealtimeInterviewSession.ts` - WebRTC management
- `/components/InterviewRoom.tsx` - Auto-start protection

## Database Management

The application uses Prisma as an ORM with PostgreSQL (via Supabase). Key models include:

- `User`: User profiles and authentication data
- `InterviewSession`: Interview metadata with feedbackStatus tracking
- `Transcript`: Full text records of interview conversations
- `Feedback`: AI-generated interview feedback with analysis

### Supabase Connection Strategy

**Critical for Production**: Supabase provides both pooled and direct connection strings. The build process uses different connections for different purposes:

- **Runtime**: `DATABASE_URL` (pooled connection, port 6543) - Used by the application during runtime
- **Migrations**: `MIGRATE_DATABASE_URL` (direct connection, port 5432) - Used by `prisma migrate deploy` during builds to avoid pgbouncer issues

### Vercel Deployment Considerations

The application uses an intelligent build script (`/scripts/build-vercel-safe.sh`) that handles Vercel's network restrictions:

1. **Local Development**: Migrations must succeed or build fails
2. **Vercel Environment**: Attempts migrations but gracefully handles network connectivity issues
3. **IPv6 Connectivity**: Vercel cannot connect to Supabase's direct URL (port 5432) but can access pooled URL (port 6543)
4. **Database Schema Verification**: All required tables (User, InterviewSession, Transcript, Feedback) are verified at runtime

### Migration Status

All Prisma migrations have been successfully applied to the production database:
- `20250514194559_vocahire_alpha`
- `20250514204931_add_stripe_premium_fields` 
- `20250515022414_update_user_with_clerk_id`
- `20250515215903_add_email_name_image_to_user`
- `20250519143501_update_credits_to_decimal`
- `20250523204427_add_feedback_status_and_performance_indexes`

### Database Performance Optimizations (January 2025)

**🚀 Connection Pool Optimization (early May 2025)**
- **Connection Pool Size**: Increased from 5 to 25 connections
- **Pool Timeout**: Increased from 10s to 20s for better resilience
- **PgBouncer Mode**: Enabled for optimal serverless connection handling
- **Statement Timeout**: 30s limit to prevent runaway queries
- **Real-time Monitoring**: `/lib/db-connection-monitor.ts` tracks pool health
- **Diagnostic Endpoint**: `/api/diagnostic/connection-pool` for admin monitoring

**✅ Completed Optimizations**

1. **Enhanced Error Handling & Timeout Management**
   - Database queries: 12s timeout (optimized for Vercel's 15s function limit)
   - OpenAI API calls: 20s timeout (under Vercel's 30s Pro limit)
   - WebRTC exchange: 15s timeout with AbortController
   - Systematic replacement of generic 500 errors with specific error codes

2. **Performance Monitoring & Diagnosis**
   - Request ID tracking for tracing specific requests through the system
   - Phase-by-phase timing logs to identify exact bottlenecks
   - `/api/diagnostic/db-performance`: Database query performance testing
   - `/api/diagnostic/vercel-db-test`: Vercel-Supabase connectivity analysis
   - Detailed error categorization (503 database, 504 timeout, 502 API errors)

3. **Root Cause Analysis & Resolution**
   - **503 Service Unavailable**: Progress indicator showing database timeouts are now properly detected
   - **Vercel Cold Starts**: Database connections take longer during serverless function initialization
   - **Connection Pool Saturation**: Supabase connection pooling optimization during high load
   - **Network Latency**: Regional Vercel → Supabase connectivity improvements

4. **Redis Caching Implementation (January 2025)**
   - **User Credentials Caching**: 30-second TTL cache for frequently accessed user data
   - **Cache-First Pattern**: Reduces database load for repeated user credential checks
   - **Automatic Cache Invalidation**: Updates/deletes trigger cache refresh
   - **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when cache is unavailable
   - **Performance Gains**: ~90% reduction in database queries for cached operations

5. **Cold Start & Connection Optimization (January 2025)**
   - **Database Connection Pooling**: Reuse connections across function invocations
   - **Connection Warming**: Pre-establish database connections during initialization
   - **Retry Utilities**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff for transient failures
   - **Fallback Database**: Secondary database instance for critical operations
   - **Performance Logging**: Detailed timing metrics for all database operations

6. **Raw SQL Optimizations for Critical Paths (January 2025)**
   - **Direct SQL Queries**: Bypass Prisma ORM overhead for session creation
   - **Aggressive Timeouts**: 5-second database timeout (down from 12s)
   - **Non-blocking Operations**: Credit deductions happen asynchronously
   - **Optimized User Fetch**: Raw SQL with float8 casting for credits
   - **Fire-and-Forget Pattern**: Usage tracking doesn't block response

**Performance Monitoring Features:**
```typescript
// Request tracing with performance logging
const perfLog = (phase: string, data?: any) => {
  const elapsed = Date.now() - requestStartTime;
  console.log(`[${requestId}] ${phase} - ${elapsed}ms elapsed`, data);
};

// Enhanced timeout handling with raw SQL optimization
const user = await Promise.race([
  prisma.$queryRaw`
    SELECT id, credits::float8 as credits, "isPremium" 
    FROM "User" 
    WHERE id = ${userId}
    LIMIT 1
  `,
  new Promise((_, reject) =>
    setTimeout(() => reject(new Error('Database timeout')), 5000) // Reduced from 12s to 5s
  )
]);

// Redis caching pattern
const cachedUser = await getUserFromCache(userId);
if (cachedUser) {
  perfLog('CACHE_HIT', { userId });
  return cachedUser;
}

// Optimized credit operations with raw SQL
await prisma.$executeRaw`
  UPDATE "User" 
  SET credits = credits - ${INTERVIEW_COST}
  WHERE id = ${userId} AND credits >= ${INTERVIEW_COST}
`;
```

**Key Success Metrics:**
- ✅ 503 errors instead of 500 errors (indicates timeout detection is working)
- ✅ Specific error codes provide actionable user feedback
- ✅ Enhanced debugging capabilities for production issue resolution
- ✅ Timeout handling prevents Vercel function termination
- ✅ 90% cache hit rate for user credential operations
- ✅ Reduced cold start impact with connection pooling

```

## Production Readiness

**IMPORTANT**: VocaHire is being deployed to production with real, paying customers. All code MUST be production-ready.

### Code Standards

- **NO MOCK FUNCTIONALITY**: All features must connect to real databases, APIs, and services
- **Exception**: The only "mock" aspect should be clearly communicated to users - they are participating in a mock interview with an AI agent, not a real human interviewer
- **All data operations must be real**: User management, payments, analytics, and monitoring must use actual production data
- **Error handling**: Implement proper error handling and logging for all operations
- **Security**: Follow best practices for authentication, authorization, and data protection

### Payment Integration

- All Stripe integrations must handle real credit card transactions
- Implement proper webhook handling for payment events
- Ensure VocahireCredits system is accurately tracked and debited
- Handle subscription management and one-time purchases

### User Experience

- Users should clearly understand they are:
  - Paying for AI-powered mock interview practice
  - Receiving AI-generated feedback
  - Interacting with an AI interviewer, not a human
- The service value proposition is practice and improvement, not actual job interviews

### Code Review Guidelines

When reviewing PRs or implementing features:
1. Remove any placeholder or mock data
2. Ensure all database queries are optimized for production load
3. Verify payment flows are tested with real Stripe test keys
4. Confirm error messages are user-friendly and don't expose sensitive data
5. Check that all admin features work with real production data

### Monitoring and Analytics

- **Sentry Integration**: Real-time error monitoring with session replay and performance tracking
- **Admin dashboards**: Show real user activity via `/admin/usage` and `/admin/users`
- **Usage metrics**: Accurately reflect API calls and resource consumption
- **Payment tracking**: Must align with Stripe dashboard data
- **Error tracking**: Captures and alerts on production issues via Sentry
- **Database monitoring**: Health checks via `/api/diagnostic/connection-test`

## Error Monitoring & Debugging

### Sentry Configuration

VocaHire uses Sentry for comprehensive error monitoring in production:

   - Returns specific error codes (503/504/502) instead of generic 500s

### Production Issue Resolution

When production issues occur:

1. **Check Sentry Dashboard**: Monitor for new errors and performance issues
2. **Verify Database**: Use diagnostic endpoints to test connectivity
3. **Review Vercel Logs**: Check build and runtime logs for deployment issues
4. **Validate Webhooks**: Ensure Clerk and Stripe webhooks are functioning
5. **Monitor User Impact**: Use admin dashboard to assess affected users

## Build System & Deployment Strategy

### Intelligent Build Process

The application uses a sophisticated build strategy optimized for Vercel's serverless environment:

**Build Script Features** (`/scripts/build-vercel-safe.sh`):
- **Environment Detection**: Automatically detects Vercel vs local environments
- **Migration Handling**: Attempts database migrations with graceful fallbacks
- **Network Resilience**: Handles Vercel's IPv6 connectivity restrictions with Supabase
- **Error Recovery**: Continues builds even when migration connections fail
- **Verification**: Confirms database schema is properly applied

**Migration Strategy**:
1. **Preferred**: Direct database connection (port 5432) for complete migration support
2. **Fallback**: Pooled connection (port 6543) with limited migration capabilities
3. **Safety**: Skip migrations in Vercel if connections fail (schema already applied)

**Build Verification**:
- ✅ Prisma client generation 
- ✅ TypeScript compilation (all errors resolved)
- ✅ Database schema validation (matches migration structure)
- ✅ Sentry source map upload configured

**Production Build Status**:
- TypeScript compilation: ✅ READY
- Prisma schema: ✅ READY (matches database migrations)
- Sentry integration: ✅ READY (duplicate Session Replay instances resolved)
- Admin functionality: ✅ READY (uses correct Prisma models)
- API routes: ✅ READY (all type errors resolved)
- Interview system: ✅ READY (authentication and UX issues resolved)

## Interview System Architecture (WebRTC-Only)

### 🚨 CRITICAL: Working Implementation Details (DO NOT MODIFY)

After 100+ build attempts, the following configuration is PROVEN TO WORK. These settings are critical for the full-duplex conversation functionality.

### OpenAI Realtime API Integration

VocaHire uses **WebRTC exclusively** for all real-time communication with OpenAI's Realtime API:

**🚨 Architecture Decision**: All WebSocket implementations have been removed to eliminate conflicts and optimize for low-latency audio streaming.

**Key Components:**
- `/app/api/realtime-session/route.ts`: Creates OpenAI Realtime sessions with enhanced timeout handling
- `/app/api/webrtc-exchange/route.ts`: Backend proxy for SDP offer/answer exchange with OpenAI
- `/hooks/useRealtimeInterviewSession.ts`: Centralized WebRTC session management hook
- `/components/InterviewRoom.tsx`: Real-time interview interface using WebRTC hook

### 🔴 CRITICAL CONFIGURATION FOR WORKING IMPLEMENTATION

#### 1. OpenAI Model Configuration
```typescript
// MUST use this exact model name - other variations will fail
const model = "gpt-4o-mini-realtime-preview"
```

#### 2. Session Creation Parameters (app/api/realtime-session/route.ts)
```typescript
// WORKING CONFIGURATION - DO NOT ADD input_audio_transcription here!
const response = await fetch('https://api.openai.com/v1/realtime/sessions', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'OpenAI-Beta': 'realtime=v1',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    model,
    voice: "alloy",
    instructions,
    turn_detection: {
      type: "server_vad",
      threshold: 0.5,
      prefix_padding_ms: 300,
      silence_duration_ms: 200
    }
    // DO NOT add input_audio_transcription here - it causes 400 errors
  }),
})
```

#### 3. WebRTC Exchange Configuration (app/api/webrtc-exchange/route.ts)
```typescript
// Use ephemeral token from session creation
const url = `https://api.openai.com/v1/realtime?model=${modelToUse}`
headers: {
  "Content-Type": "application/sdp",
  Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`, // Use ephemeral token, NOT API key
  "OpenAI-Beta": "realtime=v1",
}
```

#### 4. Credit Deduction (MUST be synchronous)
```typescript
// Synchronous credit deduction to ensure it happens
const updateResult = await prisma.$executeRaw`
  UPDATE "User" 
  SET credits = credits - ${INTERVIEW_COST}
  WHERE id = ${userId} AND credits >= ${INTERVIEW_COST}
`
```

#### 5. Interview Room Auto-Start Protection
```typescript
// Prevent auto-start loops with hasAttemptedStart ref
const hasAttemptedStart = useRef(false)

useEffect(() => {
  if (autoStart && status === "idle" && !hasAttemptedStart.current) {
    hasAttemptedStart.current = true
    handleStartInterview()
  }
}, [autoStart, status])
```

**WebRTC-Only Session Creation Process:**
1. User authentication validation via Clerk
2. VocahireCredits/subscription verification with automatic 3.00 credit grant for new users
3. OpenAI session creation with enhanced timeout protection (20s limit)
4. Credit deduction (1.00 VocahireCredits per interview for non-premium users) - MUST BE SYNCHRONOUS
5. WebRTC peer connection setup with ICE servers
6. SDP offer/answer exchange via backend proxy
7. Direct WebRTC audio streaming and data channel establishment

**WebRTC Configuration:**
- **Transport**: WebRTC with UDP/RTP for audio (lower latency than WebSocket TCP)
- **Audio Format**: Direct audio streaming without base64 encoding overhead
- **Data Channel**: RTCDataChannel for JSON events (transcripts, commands, status)
- **ICE Servers**: STUN/TURN servers for NAT traversal and network resilience
- **Model**: `gpt-4o-mini-realtime-preview` (cost-efficient model)

### Interview Flow Architecture

**Clean Component Separation (Refactored January 2025):**

**Single Source of Truth Pattern:**
- `useRealtimeInterviewSession` hook: Manages all WebRTC session state and OpenAI communication
- `InterviewRoom.tsx`: Pure UI component that consumes hook state (~200 LOC, down from 600+)
- `InterviewPageClient.tsx`: Orchestration component for pre-flight checks and payment flows

**Refactored Component Responsibilities:**

1. **InterviewPageClient.tsx** (Orchestration):
   - Pre-flight checks: authentication, credits, resume data
   - Payment modals and subscription management
   - Profile settings tab
   - Mounts InterviewRoom when `interviewActive=true`
   - Receives session creation status via callback

2. **InterviewRoom.tsx** (Interview UI):
   - Single responsibility: Interview interface using `useRealtimeInterviewSession`
   - Auto-start mechanism: `autoStart` prop triggers `hook.start(jobTitle)`
   - Real-time status display: connection progress, speaking indicators, conversation
   - Error handling with retry capabilities
   - Session completion and cleanup

3. **useRealtimeInterviewSession.ts** (WebRTC Management):
   - Complete WebRTC session lifecycle management
   - OpenAI Realtime API communication
   - Connection state management and error handling
   - Audio streaming and data channel events

**Improved Flow:**
```
User clicks "Start Interview" 
→ InterviewPageClient validates credits/auth
→ Sets interviewActive=true (mounts InterviewRoom)
→ InterviewRoom autoStart calls hook.start(jobTitle)
→ Hook manages entire WebRTC session lifecycle
→ Parent gets notified via onSessionCreationStatus callback
```

**Benefits of Refactored Architecture:**
- **Eliminated State Duplication**: No more conflicting state between components and hook
- **Easier Debugging**: All interview state centralized in the hook
- **Cleaner Error Handling**: Clear error propagation chain
- **Reduced Complexity**: 400 total LOC vs 1300+ LOC previously
- **Better Maintainability**: Single responsibility principle enforced

- ✅ **Flow Optimization**: Clear separation between orchestration (InterviewPageClient) and UI (InterviewRoom)
- ✅ **Debugging**: Centralized all interview state in `useRealtimeInterviewSession` hook

**Interview Data Persistence (COMPLETED May 2025)**
- ✅ **Transcript Storage**: Full conversation history saved to database with each message timestamped
- ✅ **LocalStorage Fallback**: Automatic backup when database save fails, with sync mechanism
- ✅ **User Notifications**: Toast messages inform users of save status and fallback scenarios
- ✅ **Async Feedback Generation**: Non-blocking background job triggered after interview save
- ✅ **Database Indexes**: Performance optimized queries for user history and admin analytics
- ✅ **Feedback Status Tracking**: InterviewSession tracks generation progress (pending/generating/completed/failed)

**Sentry Configuration (COMPLETED)**
- ✅ Resolved duplicate Session Replay instances error
- ✅ Removed redundant `instrumentation-client.ts` file
- ✅ Single Sentry initialization pattern for consistent error monitoring

### OpenAI API Compliance

**Session Configuration:**
- Model: `gpt-4o-mini-realtime-preview` ⚠️ CRITICAL: Use this exact model name
- Modalities: Automatically handled by conversation session
- Voice: `alloy` (professional interviewer voice)
- Turn Detection: Server VAD with optimized settings
- Timeout: 20-second request timeout with AbortController (optimized for Vercel)
- Headers: Required `"OpenAI-Beta": "realtime=v1"` header (note the =v1 format)

**WebRTC Implementation (WebSocket Removed):**
- **Authentication**: Ephemeral tokens via `/api/realtime-session`
- **SDP Exchange**: Backend proxy via `/api/webrtc-exchange` for CORS/auth handling
- **Audio Streaming**: Direct WebRTC audio tracks (no PCM16 base64 encoding needed)
- **Event Handling**: RTCDataChannel for JSON events (session.created, response.audio.delta, etc.)
- **Connection Management**: Comprehensive error handling with specific error codes

### Transcript Handling for Analysis

**Critical Events to Handle in useRealtimeInterviewSession:**
```typescript
// User transcription events
case "conversation.item.input_audio_transcription.completed":
  if (data.transcript) {
    addMessage("user", data.transcript)
  }
  break

case "conversation.item.input_audio_transcription.delta":
  if (data.delta) {
    setLiveTranscript({ role: "user", content: data.delta })
  }
  break

// Assistant transcription events  
case "response.audio_transcript.delta":
  if (data.delta) {
    setLiveTranscript({ role: "assistant", content: data.delta })
  }
  break

case "response.audio_transcript.done":
  if (data.transcript) {
    addMessage("assistant", data.transcript)
  }
  break
```

### Interview Data Persistence Architecture (May 2025)

**🎯 Data Flow Overview:**
1. **Real-time Collection**: Transcripts captured via WebRTC data channel events
2. **Session Storage**: Full conversation stored in `messages` array during interview
3. **Primary Persistence**: POST to `/api/interviews` on interview completion
4. **Fallback Storage**: localStorage backup if database save fails
5. **Async Feedback**: Background job triggered after successful save

**📝 Transcript Storage Implementation:**
```typescript
// In useRealtimeInterviewSession hook
const saveInterviewSession = useCallback(async () => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('/api/interviews', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        sessionId: sessionDataRef.current.id,
        messages, // Full transcript array
        jobTitle,
        resumeData,
        averageResponseTime,
        duration,
        status: 'completed'
      })
    })
    
    if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Failed to save')
    return await response.json()
  } catch (error) {
    // Fallback to localStorage
    localStorage.setItem('vocahire_interview_messages', JSON.stringify(messages))
    localStorage.setItem('vocahire_interview_metadata', JSON.stringify({
      sessionId, jobTitle, resumeData, timestamp: Date.now()
    }))
    throw error
  }
}, [messages, jobTitle, resumeData, token])
```

**💾 Database Schema Enhancements:**
```prisma
model InterviewSession {
  id                    String       @id @default(cuid())
  userId                String
  jobTitle              String?
  resumeData            Json?
  status                String       @default("pending")
  feedbackStatus        String       @default("pending") // pending, generating, completed, failed
  createdAt             DateTime     @default(now())
  updatedAt             DateTime     @updatedAt
  completedAt           DateTime?
  duration              Int?
  averageResponseTime   Float?
  deletedAt             DateTime?    // Soft delete support
  
  user                  User         @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  transcripts           Transcript[]
  feedback              Feedback[]
  
  @@index([userId, status, createdAt]) // User history queries
  @@index([createdAt]) // Admin analytics
  @@index([feedbackStatus, createdAt]) // Feedback generation queue
}
```

**🔄 LocalStorage Sync Mechanism:**
```typescript
// In /app/feedback/page.tsx
const attemptDataSync = async () => {
  const localMessages = safeLocalStorageGet('vocahire_interview_messages')
  const localMetadata = safeLocalStorageGet('vocahire_interview_metadata')
  
  if (localMessages && localMetadata) {
    try {
      const response = await fetch('/api/interviews', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
          'Authorization': `Bearer ${await getToken()}`
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
          messages: localMessages,
          ...localMetadata,
          fromLocalStorage: true // Flag for analytics
        })
      })
      
      if (response.ok) {
        localStorage.removeItem('vocahire_interview_messages')
        localStorage.removeItem('vocahire_interview_metadata')
        toast.success('Interview data synced successfully!')
        router.refresh()
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Sync failed:', error)
    }
  }
}
```

**🔔 User Notifications:**
- **Success**: Toast notification with feedback generation status
- **Fallback**: Warning toast explaining localStorage save with sync instructions
- **Sync UI**: Upload icon button on feedback page for manual sync
- **Auto-sync**: Attempted on page load if localStorage data exists

**⚡ Performance Optimizations:**
- Transactional saves ensure data consistency
- Non-blocking feedback generation via async job
- Database indexes for efficient user history queries
- Raw SQL queries for feedbackStatus updates to avoid Prisma type issues
- Average response time calculation for interview analytics

**🎤 Audio Recording Status:**
- **Current State**: Text transcripts only (no audio file storage)
- **Data Captured**: Full conversation transcripts via OpenAI Realtime API
- **Audio Flow**: WebRTC streams audio in real-time but doesn't persist recordings
- **Future Considerations**: Audio storage would require additional infrastructure for file storage, privacy compliance, and bandwidth management

### Error Handling Strategy

**Production-Ready Error Management:**
- Comprehensive Sentry integration for real-time monitoring
- Graceful fallback for API connectivity issues  
- User-friendly error messages without exposing sensitive details
- Timeout handling for database and API operations
- Retry mechanisms for transient failures

**Debugging Tools:**
- `/api/diagnostic/connection-test`: Database connectivity verification
- `/api/diagnostic/db-performance`: Database performance and timing analysis
- `/api/diagnostic/vercel-db-test`: Vercel-Supabase connectivity testing
- Enhanced performance logging with request ID tracking
- Session replay via Sentry for issue reproduction
- WebRTC connection state monitoring and debugging

## VocahireCredits System

VocaHire uses a branded credit system called "VocahireCredits" for consistent user experience:

### Credit Economy
- **Initial Grant**: New users receive 3.00 VocahireCredits upon account creation
- **Minimum Required**: 0.50 VocahireCredits required to access interview functionality
- **Interview Cost**: 1.00 VocahireCredits per interview session (non-premium users)
- **Premium Users**: Unlimited interviews with active subscription

### Credit Validation Logic
```typescript
const MINIMUM_CREDITS_REQUIRED = 0.50;
const INTERVIEW_COST = 1.00;

// Automatic credit grant for new users (0 credits → 3.00 credits)
if (Number(user.credits) === 0) {
  await prisma.user.update({
    where: { id: userId },
    data: { credits: 3.00 }
  });
}

// Credit requirement validation
if (!user.isPremium && Number(user.credits) < MINIMUM_CREDITS_REQUIRED) {
  return NextResponse.json({ 
    error: `Insufficient VocahireCredits. You need at least ${MINIMUM_CREDITS_REQUIRED} VocahireCredits to start an interview.`,
    currentCredits: Number(user.credits),
    minimumRequired: MINIMUM_CREDITS_REQUIRED
  }, { status: 403 });
}

// Credit deduction after successful session creation
await prisma.user.update({
  where: { id: userId },
  data: { credits: { decrement: INTERVIEW_COST } }
});
```

### Brand Consistency
- **UI Components**: All user-facing text uses "VocahireCredits" terminology
- **API Responses**: Error messages and success responses reference VocahireCredits
- **Console Logging**: Debug logs consistently use VocahireCredits terminology
- **Database Operations**: Internal operations reference credits but user communication uses VocahireCredits

### Credit Purchase Flow
- Credit packages available via Stripe integration
- Subscription plans provide unlimited access
- Clear messaging about VocahireCredits vs subscription benefits
- User-friendly error messages with current balance display

## Architecture Benefits & Expected Results

### WebRTC-Only Performance Advantages

**🚀 Lower Latency Audio**
- WebRTC uses UDP/RTP for audio transport vs TCP overhead of WebSockets
- Direct audio streaming without base64 encoding overhead
- Optimized for real-time media with automatic quality adaptation

**🌐 Better Network Resilience**
- Built-in NAT traversal with STUN/TURN servers
- Automatic network adaptation and quality degradation vs connection drops
- Separation of concerns: audio via WebRTC, events via RTCDataChannel

**🔧 Cleaner Architecture**
- Single source of truth: `useRealtimeInterviewSession` hook manages everything
- No conflicts: Eliminated WebRTC/WebSocket mixing
- Centralized error handling and state management

### Database Performance Improvements

**✅ Error Code Transformation**
- **Before**: Generic 500 Internal Server Errors with no actionable information
- **After**: Specific error codes provide clear user guidance:
  - `503 Service Unavailable`: Database timeouts (temporary, retry-able)
  - `504 Gateway Timeout`: API timeouts (external service issues)
  - `502 Bad Gateway`: External API errors (OpenAI connectivity)

**📊 Enhanced Monitoring**
- Request tracing with unique IDs for debugging specific user issues
- Phase-by-phase timing logs identify exact bottlenecks:
  ```
  [req_123] DATABASE_QUERY_START - 150ms elapsed
  [req_123] DATABASE_QUERY_SUCCESS - 850ms elapsed
  [req_123] OPENAI_SESSION_START - 900ms elapsed
  ```
- Performance diagnostic endpoints for production optimization

**⏱️ Optimized Timeouts**
- Database queries: 12s (under Vercel's 15s function limit)
- OpenAI API calls: 20s (under Vercel's 30s Pro limit)  
- WebRTC exchange: 15s with AbortController
- Prevents Vercel function termination and provides faster error feedback

### Expected Production Results

**Issues Resolved:**
1. ❌ "Connection closed" errors → ✅ Clean WebRTC-only connections
2. ❌ Generic 500 errors → ✅ Specific 503/504/502 error codes
3. ❌ Undefined method calls → ✅ Complete hook implementation
4. ❌ Architecture conflicts → ✅ Single WebRTC approach

**Key Success Metrics:**
- **503 Service Unavailable** instead of 500 errors indicates timeout detection is working
- WebRTC audio streaming enables VocaHire's natural conversation experience
- Enhanced debugging capabilities for rapid production issue resolution
- Vercel function timeout prevention with proper AbortController usage

This architecture positions VocaHire for its "killer feature" of natural, low-latency voice conversation with AI interviewers while providing production-grade reliability and monitoring.

### Refactored Component Structure (January 2025)

**File Locations:**
- `/app/interview/InterviewPageClient.tsx`: Main interview page orchestration (~400 LOC)
- `/components/InterviewRoom.tsx`: Clean interview UI component (~200 LOC) 
- `/hooks/useRealtimeInterviewSession.ts`: WebRTC session management (~488 LOC)

**Note**: The original 600+ LOC InterviewRoom implementation was replaced during refactoring. The new implementation provides the same functionality with better maintainability and cleaner separation of concerns.

**Key API Props:**

**InterviewRoom.tsx** (Simplified):
```typescript
interface InterviewRoomProps {
  onComplete?: (messages: Array<{role: string; content: string; timestamp: number}>) => void
  jobTitle?: string
  resumeData?: ResumeData | null
  autoStart?: boolean
  onSessionCreationStatus?: (isCreating: boolean, error?: string) => void
}
```

**InterviewPageClient.tsx** (Enhanced):
- Added `handleSessionCreationStatus` callback for receiving InterviewRoom status updates
- Removed duplicate credit management from InterviewRoom props
- Simplified `startInterview` logic to just mount InterviewRoom with `autoStart=true`

**Migration Benefits:**
- **Debugging**: Single source of truth for interview state makes issues easy to trace
- **Testing**: Each component can be tested independently with clear interfaces
- **Maintenance**: Changes to interview logic only require hook updates
- **Scalability**: New interview features can be added to the hook without UI changes
