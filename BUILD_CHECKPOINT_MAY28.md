# Build Checkpoint - May 28, 2025 ðŸŽ‰

## Successful Build Status
- **Date**: May 28, 2025 12:04 PM CST
- **Commit**: 3f78636 - "fix: improve error handling for missing secrets in development mode"
- **Status**: âœ… BUILD SUCCESS

## Key Success Factors

### 1. Secret Manager Error Handling Fix
The final fix that enabled successful builds was correcting the logical error in `lib/secret-manager.ts`:
- **Problem**: Unreachable code checking for development mode inside production-only catch block
- **Solution**: Moved development check outside of production-only Secret Manager try/catch
- **Impact**: Proper error handling for missing secrets in both dev and production

### 2. Previous Critical Fixes (Leading to Success)

#### TypeScript & Build Configuration
- Fixed strict TypeScript compilation errors
- Removed experimental Genkit features causing ESLint errors
- Downgraded Next.js from 15.3.2 to 15.2.3 to resolve webpack issues
- Added NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY as Docker build argument

#### Architecture Simplification
- Removed WebRTC components and routes completely
- Eliminated Google Cloud Storage dependencies for MVP
- Focused on SSE (Server-Sent Events) for real-time communication
- Stubbed recording routes to return 501 Not Implemented

#### Prisma Configuration
- Fixed Prisma client copy path in Dockerfile
- Added generated Prisma files to .gitignore
- Proper handling of Supabase connection strings

## Build Configuration That Works

### Dockerfile Key Elements
```dockerfile
ARG NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_Y2xlcmsudm9jYWhpcmUuY29tJA
ENV NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=${NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY}
COPY --from=builder /app/prisma/generated ./prisma/generated
```

### Cloud Build Inline Configuration
- Uses inline build config (not cloudbuild.yaml)
- Includes --build-arg for Clerk publishable key
- Proper substitution variable handling

## Current Production Status
- **Cloud Run URL**: https://v0-vocahire-727828254616.us-central1.run.app/ âœ…
- **Custom Domain**: https://vocahire.com (DNS propagating)
- **Health Endpoint**: /api/health (publicly accessible)
- **Ready Endpoint**: /api/ready (publicly accessible)

## Lessons Learned

1. **Environment Variables**: Always check build-time vs runtime requirements
2. **Error Handling**: Ensure logical flow makes sense (no unreachable code)
3. **MVP Focus**: Removing complex features (WebRTC, GCS) simplified deployment
4. **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Fix all errors, don't ignore them
5. **Dependencies**: Keep versions stable (Next.js downgrade was crucial)

## Next Steps
- Monitor DNS propagation for vocahire.com
- Ensure SSL certificate provisions after DNS verification
- Continue with MVP testing and polish
- Maintain this simplified architecture until post-MVP

## Critical Files for Reference
- `/lib/secret-manager.ts` - Proper secret handling
- `/Dockerfile` - Working Docker configuration
- `/middleware.ts` - Public route configuration
- `/.gitignore` - Includes /prisma/generated/
- `/CLAUDE.md` - Updated documentation
