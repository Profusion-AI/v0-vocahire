# 503 Service Unavailable Fix Summary

## Problem
VocaHire's real-time interview functionality was experiencing persistent 503 Service Unavailable errors on the `/api/realtime-session` endpoint, preventing users from starting AI interview sessions.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Model Version Issues**: Using outdated or incorrect OpenAI Realtime API model names
2. **Database Connection Latency**: Cold starts and connection pool saturation causing timeouts
3. **Insufficient Timeouts**: 5-second database timeout too aggressive for production environment
4. **Missing Cache Layer**: No caching for frequently accessed user credentials
5. **API Header Format**: Outdated OpenAI-Beta header format

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Updated OpenAI Model Configuration
- Changed from `gpt-4o-realtime-preview` to `gpt-4o-realtime-preview-2024-12-17`
- Updated OpenAI-Beta header from `realtime` to `realtime=v1`
- Added comprehensive session configuration with voice settings and VAD parameters

### 2. Enhanced Database Performance
- Integrated user credential caching with Redis/fallback
- Added database connection warming before queries
- Implemented retry logic with exponential backoff for database queries
- Increased database timeout from 5s to 8s with 2 retry attempts

### 3. Improved Error Handling & Debugging
- Added request ID tracking for all requests and responses
- Enhanced logging with timestamps and environment details
- Specific error messages for different failure scenarios
- Added processing time metrics to successful responses

### 4. WebRTC Configuration Updates
- Updated model in webrtc-exchange route to match session creation
- Fixed OpenAI-Beta header format in SDP exchange
- Increased OpenAI API timeout from 15s to 20s

### 5. Client-Side Improvements
- Hook already has retry logic with exponential backoff
- Proper error code handling (503, 504, 502)
- Clear user messaging for temporary unavailability

## Files Modified
1. `/app/api/realtime-session/route.ts`
   - Added caching support
   - Implemented retry logic for database queries
   - Enhanced logging and error tracking
   - Updated model and header configuration

2. `/app/api/webrtc-exchange/route.ts`
   - Updated model to use latest version
   - Fixed OpenAI-Beta header format

3. `/hooks/useRealtimeInterviewSession.ts`
   - Updated model reference to match backend

4. `/lib/prisma-pool.ts` (created)
   - Production-optimized connection pooling configuration

## Testing & Verification

To verify the fixes:

1. **Check logs for request tracking**:
   ```
   === REALTIME SESSION REQUEST START [req_xxx] ===
   [req_xxx] DATABASE_QUERY_START - 150ms
   [req_xxx] OPENAI_SESSION_COMPLETE - 2500ms
   === REALTIME SESSION REQUEST END [req_xxx] - Total: 3000ms ===
   ```

2. **Monitor for proper error codes**:
   - 503: Database timeout (with retry guidance)
   - 504: OpenAI API timeout
   - 502: External API errors

3. **Verify cache hits**:
   ```
   [DB Query] Cache hit for user xxx - 5ms
   ```

## Expected Results
- Reduced 503 errors through retry mechanisms
- Faster response times with caching (90% cache hit rate expected)
- Better debugging with request ID tracking
- Clear error messages guiding users to retry
- Successful WebRTC voice conversations with the AI interviewer

## Next Steps
1. Deploy to production
2. Monitor Sentry for error rates
3. Check Vercel function logs for performance metrics
4. Verify Redis cache hit rates
5. Consider implementing edge caching if issues persist
