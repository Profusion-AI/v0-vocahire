# Cloud Run Diagnostics Report
**Date**: May 28, 2025
**Time**: 3:30 PM CST

## üîç Key Findings from Cloud Run Logs

### 1. Network Request Storm (CRITICAL)
**Issue**: The client is sending 30+ requests to `/api/interview-v2/session` within 30 milliseconds
```
- 30 requests between 21:08:39.775 - 21:08:39.803 (28ms)
- Mix of 200 OK and 404 responses
- This is causing ERR_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES on client
```

**Root Cause**: Already fixed in previous commits - the `sendData` was checking `isConnected` instead of `status === 'streaming'`

### 2. Prisma Connection Pool Error (FIXED)
**Issue**: ConnectionPoolMonitor failing with error:
```
Failed to update metrics: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '_createPrismaPromise')
```

**Root Cause**: The connection pool monitor was importing the Prisma proxy directly instead of awaiting `getPrismaClient()`

**Fix Applied**: Changed import from `prisma` to `getPrismaClient()` and properly await the client

### 3. The _rsc 404 Mystery (IDENTIFIED)
**Finding**: The _rsc requests are actually returning 200 OK in logs:
```
- /feedback?_rsc=1ekmi - 200 OK
- /profile?_rsc=1ekmi - 200 OK  
- /prepare?_rsc=1ekmi - 200 OK
```

**Explanation**: _rsc is Next.js's React Server Component protocol. The 404 in browser console might be:
- A prefetch that's failing
- A client-side routing mismatch
- Or a false positive in Chrome DevTools

**This is NOT causing the main issue** - it's a red herring.

## üìä Production Status

Based on Cloud Run logs:
- ‚úÖ Service is deployed and responding
- ‚úÖ Routes are accessible (mix of 200s and 404s)
- ‚ùå High request volume causing client-side resource exhaustion
- ‚ùå Database connection pool monitor was failing (now fixed)

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Before Next Build)
1. **The Prisma fix is already committed** - This should resolve the connection pool errors

2. **The network storm fix is already deployed** - Previous commits fixed the streaming status check

3. **Test locally first**:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   # Then visit http://localhost:3000/interview-v2
   # Check console for any errors before clicking "Start Interview"
   ```

### For the Next Build
When you're ready to deploy:

```bash
# Verify all fixes are committed
git status

# Push to trigger Cloud Build
git push origin main

# Monitor the build
gcloud builds list --limit=1 --project=vocahire-prod

# After deployment, check logs
gcloud logging read 'resource.type="cloud_run_revision" resource.labels.service_name="v0-vocahire" severity>=ERROR' --project=vocahire-prod --limit=20 --freshness=10m
```

## üéØ Expected Outcomes After Next Deployment

1. **No more Prisma connection errors** - The async initialization is fixed
2. **No more network storms** - Already fixed in previous commits
3. **Clean console on page load** - No errors until user interaction
4. **Stable interview sessions** - Should connect properly when clicking "Start Interview"

## üìù Additional Notes

- The _rsc 404 can be ignored for now - it's not affecting functionality
- The high request volume (30 requests in 28ms) confirms the network exhaustion theory
- All critical fixes have been identified and implemented
- Local testing is recommended before the next deployment

## üîß Monitoring Commands Post-Deployment

```bash
# Check for connection pool errors
gcloud logging read 'resource.type="cloud_run_revision" "ConnectionPoolMonitor"' --project=vocahire-prod --limit=10 --freshness=30m

# Check interview session requests
gcloud logging read 'resource.type="cloud_run_revision" "interview-v2/session"' --project=vocahire-prod --limit=50 --freshness=10m | jq -r '.[] | .timestamp' | sort | uniq -c

# Check for any 500 errors
gcloud logging read 'resource.type="cloud_run_revision" httpRequest.status=500' --project=vocahire-prod --limit=10 --freshness=1h
```
