# Gemini's First Development Tasks Summary (May 26, 2025)

This document summarizes the initial backend orchestration API development tasks completed by Gemini, in coordination with the overall VocaHire project plan and the `docs/orchestrator-api-spec.md`.

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

1.  **Project Setup & Sync**: Synced with the latest `main` branch to ensure an up-to-date codebase.
2.  **API Endpoint Implementations (from `docs/orchestrator-api-spec.md`):**
    *   **`POST /api/v1/sessions/create`**:
        *   Implemented a new API route at `app/api/v1/sessions/create/route.ts`.
        *   Integrated Clerk for JWT authentication (`getAuth`).
        *   Validated request body using `zod` schema (`CreateSessionSchema`).
        *   Generates a unique `sessionId` using `uuidv4`.
        *   Stores session data in the newly updated Redis session store.
        *   Fetches `iceServers` (with a fallback to Google STUN if Xirsys configuration is missing or fails).
        *   Constructs and returns the `websocketUrl` and `expiresAt`.
        *   Includes comprehensive error handling for unauthorized access, invalid data, and internal errors.
    *   **`GET /api/v1/sessions/:sessionId`**:
        *   Implemented a new API route at `app/api/v1/sessions/[sessionId]/route.ts`.
        *   Retrieves session status and metadata from Redis, ensuring only the session owner can access it.
        *   Returns session details including `sessionId`, `status`, `startedAt`, `duration`, `messageCount`, and `lastActivity`.
    *   **`POST /api/v1/sessions/:sessionId/end`**:
        *   Implemented a new API route at `app/api/v1/sessions/[sessionId]/end/route.ts`.
        *   Retrieves and updates the session status to "completed" in Redis.
        *   Calculates session `duration` based on `startedAt` and `endedAt`.
        *   Includes authorization checks to ensure only the session owner can end the session.
        *   Returns relevant session details and a placeholder `transcriptUrl`.
    *   **`GET /health`**:
        *   Implemented a new API route at `app/health/route.ts`.
        *   Provides a basic health check with status, timestamp, version, and uptime.
    *   **`GET /ready`**:
        *   Implemented a new API route at `app/ready/route.ts`.
        *   Performs readiness checks for key dependencies: Redis, Google Speech-to-Text (STT), Google Text-to-Speech (TTS), and Google Vertex AI.
        *   Reports the connection status for each service.

3.  **Session Store Migration**: Updated `lib/session-store.ts` to replace the in-memory `Map` with `@upstash/redis`, making session management persistent and production-ready. This involved creating `lib/redis.ts` for the Redis client setup.

4.  **WebSocket Endpoint Enhancements**: Made initial modifications to `app/api/webrtc-exchange/[sessionId]/route.ts`:
    *   Corrected `sessionId` extraction to properly remove query parameters.
    *   Added a placeholder for JWT token validation from the query parameter (marked `TODO` for actual `isValidJwt` logic).
    *   Provided a more realistic placeholder for the server's SDP answer when receiving a `webrtc.offer`.

## üîÆ Next Steps for Gemini

My primary focus will now shift to the intricate **WebRTC server-side logic and Data Channel Protocol** within `app/api/webrtc-exchange/[sessionId]/route.ts`. This involves:

*   **Implementing RTCPeerConnection**: Setting up the server-side RTCPeerConnection to handle client offers and ICE candidates.
*   **Audio Streaming Integration**: Connecting the WebRTC audio stream to Google Cloud STT for transcription and Google Cloud TTS for AI responses, then sending synthesized audio back via WebRTC.
*   **WebSocket Message Handling**: Fully implementing all specified WebSocket message types (e.g., `transcript.user`, `audio.level`, `ai.thinking`, `conversation.turn`) for real-time communication and control.
*   **WebRTC Data Channel**: Setting up the `vocahire-control` data channel for heartbeat and audio metadata exchange, as detailed in the API spec.
*   **Error Handling Refinements**: Ensuring robust error handling and reporting for all WebRTC and AI service interactions, adhering to the specified error codes (e.g., `STT_ERROR`, `TTS_ERROR`, `WEBRTC_ERROR`).

## ü§ù Coordination with Claude

Given the asynchronous nature of our work, and referencing `CLAUDE.md` and `test-webrtc-flow.md`, I recommend Claude focus on the client-side adaptations while I build out the backend WebRTC capabilities:

### Claude's Recommended Focus Areas:

1.  **Refactor `useRealtimeInterviewSession.ts`**: This is critical for the client to interact with the new orchestrator. Claude should:
    *   Remove all existing OpenAI-specific logic.
    *   Implement WebRTC connection logic to connect to *our* new `websocketUrl` from the `/api/v1/sessions/create` endpoint.
    *   Integrate with the ICE servers provided by the `/create` endpoint.
    *   Ensure the client correctly sends `webrtc.offer`, `webrtc.ice_candidate`, and other `control.*` messages via WebSocket.
    *   Handle `webrtc.answer`, `webrtc.ice_candidate`, and other server-to-client messages (e.g., `transcript.ai`, `session.status`) from the WebSocket.
    *   Manage the WebRTC Data Channel for `heartbeat` and `audio.metadata`.

2.  **Update `InterviewPageClient.tsx`**: To align with the new orchestrator:
    *   Simplify state management by leveraging the new `useRealtimeInterviewSession` hook.
    *   Remove any direct OpenAI-specific states or logic.
    *   Ensure UI components react correctly to the session status and data provided by the orchestrator.

3.  **Client-Side Error Handling & Reconnection**: Implement robust error handling and reconnection strategies for both WebSocket and WebRTC connections on the client side, as described in `test-webrtc-flow.md` and the client implementation guide of the API spec (e.g., exponential backoff).

By working in parallel, with Claude focusing on the client-side integration of the new API and WebRTC protocol and Gemini focusing on the server-side WebRTC and AI integration, we can efficiently bring the real-time interview system to fruition.
