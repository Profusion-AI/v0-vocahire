# Google Live API Compliance Check

**Date**: May 29, 2025  
**Purpose**: Verify VocaHire's implementation against Google's Live API documentation

## Key Findings

### ‚úÖ Compliant Areas

1. **WebSocket Connection**
   - VocaHire correctly uses WebSocket for bidirectional streaming
   - Proper WebSocket URL construction in `google-live-api.ts`

2. **Audio Format**
   - Correctly uses 16-bit PCM format
   - Proper base64 encoding for audio transmission
   - Correct MIME type: `audio/pcm;rate=16000`

3. **Message Structure**
   - Proper use of `realtimeInput` for audio chunks
   - Correct `clientContent` for text messages
   - Proper handling of `serverContent` responses

4. **Transcription Support**
   - Correctly enables both `outputAudioTranscription` and `inputAudioTranscription`
   - Properly handles transcript messages from server

5. **Voice Configuration**
   - Uses supported voice "Aoede" 
   - Correct structure: `speechConfig.voiceConfig.prebuiltVoiceConfig.voiceName`

### ‚ùå Non-Compliant Areas

1. **Custom Fields Not Supported by Google**
   - `timestamp` and `sequenceNumber` fields in messages
   - Google's API doesn't echo these back
   - VocaHire correctly handles this client-side only

2. **Audio Stream End**
   - `audioStreamEnd` is sent but may not be needed for continuous streaming
   - Google docs show it's used when stream is paused

3. **Response Modalities**
   - Currently hardcoded to `['AUDIO']`
   - Should allow configuration between TEXT and AUDIO per session

### üîß Recommendations

1. **Remove Non-Standard Fields from API Calls**
   - Keep timestamp/sequenceNumber tracking client-side only
   - Don't send these fields to Google's API

2. **Fix WebSocket Implementation**
   - Next.js doesn't support WebSocket routes natively
   - Current `/ws/route.ts` with SOCKET export won't work
   - Need to either:
     - Use a custom Node.js server
     - Revert to HTTP/SSE approach
     - Use a WebSocket proxy service

3. **Model Selection**
   - Consider using native audio models:
     - `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-native-audio-dialog`
     - `gemini-2.5-flash-exp-native-audio-thinking-dialog`
   - Current fallback to `gemini-2.0-flash-live-001` is good

4. **Session Configuration**
   - Allow responseModality to be configurable
   - Add support for system instructions
   - Consider adding VAD configuration

### ‚úÖ Security Compliance

- API key is server-side only (good!)
- No client-side exposure of credentials
- Proper use of environment variables

## Summary

VocaHire's core Google Live API integration is mostly compliant. The main issues are:
1. The WebSocket route won't work with Next.js App Router
2. Some minor field naming/structure adjustments needed
3. Should make response modality configurable

The client-side latency tracking approach is clever and correctly handles Google's limitations.
