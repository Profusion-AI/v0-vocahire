=== Interview Setup Test ===

This test verifies that the interview page doesn't make premature connection attempts.

To test manually:
1. Open browser DevTools Network tab
2. Navigate to /interview-v2
3. Observe that NO requests are made to /api/interview-v2/session
4. Fill in the session setup form
5. Click "Start Interview"
6. Only NOW should you see requests to /api/interview-v2/session

Expected Network Activity:
- Before clicking "Start Interview": No session-related requests
- After clicking "Start Interview": POST to /api/interview-v2/session

Common Issues Fixed:
1. useGenkitRealtime hook no longer initializes connections with dummy config
2. LiveInterview component no longer auto-connects on mount
3. Connection is only established after session setup is complete

If you see "Failed to parse URL from /pipeline" errors:
- This is likely from Genkit client code trying to connect to flow endpoints
- Since we use Google AI Live API directly, these can be ignored
- These errors should not affect the interview functionality
