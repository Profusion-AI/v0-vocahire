# Edge Case Implementation Progress

**Date**: May 27, 2025, 3:00 PM CST  
**Status**: In Progress

## 🎯 Current Task
Implementing comprehensive edge case handling based on Gemini's edge-testing.md document.

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Microphone Permission Edge Cases (DONE)
- Enhanced `useAudioStream` hook with:
  - Custom error types: `MicrophonePermissionError`, `MicrophoneNotFoundError`
  - Permission state tracking: `hasPermission`, `isCheckingPermission`
  - Explicit `requestPermission()` method
  - Real-time permission monitoring with revocation detection
  - Track onended events for permission loss during session
- Updated `LiveInterview` component with:
  - Permission error UI with clear CTAs
  - Disabled controls when no permission
  - Auto-start stream when permission granted

### 2. Form Validation Edge Cases (DONE)
- Enhanced `SessionSetup` component with:
  - Real-time field validation with touch tracking
  - Character limits and invalid character detection
  - Rapid submission prevention (1-second throttle)
  - Submit attempt tracking with helpful messages after failures
  - Focus management on first error field
  - Comprehensive error messages with field-level display
  - Async form submission support

### 3. Real-time Connection Failure Recovery (DONE)
- Enhanced `useGenkitRealtime` hook with:
  - Exponential backoff with configurable multiplier and max delay
  - Reconnection attempt tracking with `isReconnectingRef`
  - Clear timeout management to prevent overlapping attempts
  - Callbacks for `onReconnecting` and `onReconnected` events
  - Proper cleanup on disconnect to cancel pending reconnections
  - Connection success detection that triggers `onReconnected` callback
- Updated `LiveInterview` component with:
  - Reconnection progress UI with attempt counter
  - Visual progress bar showing reconnection progress
  - Connection lost alert when max attempts exceeded
  - Disabled controls during reconnection
- Updated `page.tsx` to track reconnection state
- Simplified `InterviewControls` to disable buttons during reconnection

## 🚧 Remaining Tasks (from TodoList)

### 4. User Navigation Cleanup (DONE)
- Enhanced `useGenkitRealtime` hook with:
  - `beforeunload` event handler that uses `navigator.sendBeacon` for reliable disconnect
  - Browser warning prompt when leaving during active interview
  - `visibilitychange` event handler to track tab switching
  - Proper cleanup of all event listeners on unmount
- LiveInterview component:
  - Already has proper cleanup in unmount effect
  - Documentation for router navigation handling

### High Priority

### Medium Priority
3. **Add comprehensive error boundaries** (edge-5)
   - Wrap main components
   - Graceful error recovery UI

4. **Implement data inconsistency handlers** (edge-6)
   - Handle empty transcripts
   - Handle delayed audio chunks
   - Handle missing feedback data

5. **Add button state management** (edge-7)
   - Disable controls based on connection state
   - Visual feedback for disabled states

## 📝 Key Implementations

### useAudioStream Hook Enhancements
```typescript
// Custom error types for better handling
export class MicrophonePermissionError extends Error { ... }
export class MicrophoneNotFoundError extends Error { ... }

// New permission management
hasPermission: boolean | null;
isCheckingPermission: boolean;
requestPermission: () => Promise<void>;
```

### SessionSetup Validation
```typescript
// Enhanced schema with regex and transforms
domainOrRole: z.string()
  .min(2, 'Job role must be at least 2 characters')
  .max(100, 'Job role must be less than 100 characters')
  .regex(/^[a-zA-Z0-9\s\-\/&,.()]+$/, 'Job role contains invalid characters')
  .transform(str => str.trim())

// Touch tracking for better UX
const [touched, setTouched] = useState<Record<string, boolean>>({});
```

## 🔄 Next Steps
1. Continue with real-time connection failure recovery
2. Test all implemented edge cases
3. Update edge-testing.md with correct method signatures
4. Run comprehensive test suite

## 📋 Notes
- All changes maintain backward compatibility
- Focus on user-friendly error messages
- Graceful degradation when features unavailable
- Following Google Live API best practices
