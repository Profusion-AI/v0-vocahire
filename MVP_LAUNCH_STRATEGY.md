# 🚀 MVP Launch Strategy - VocaHire

**Created**: May 29, 2025  
**Launch**: June 1, 2025 (48 hours)  
**Philosophy**: Ship fast, learn from users, iterate quickly

## 🎯 MVP Core Value

**"The magic is in the real-time voice interaction"**

Users should experience: "Wow, I'm actually talking to an AI!"

## ✅ What's Already Working

1. **Deployment** - Successfully on Cloud Run
2. **Authentication** - Clerk fully functional  
3. **AI Conversations** - Google Live API integrated
4. **Payments** - Stripe ready
5. **Database** - Storing transcripts & feedback
6. **CI/CD** - Automated builds

## 🔥 What MUST Work for Launch

### Critical User Journey
```
Sign up (3 free credits) → Start Interview → AI Conversation → See Feedback → Purchase More
```

### Non-Negotiables
- [ ] User can sign up and get 3 credits
- [ ] User can have AI conversation (< 1.5s latency)
- [ ] User sees transcript and feedback
- [ ] User can purchase credits/subscription
- [ ] Errors degrade gracefully (no crashes)

## 🛑 What Can Wait (Post-MVP)

### Features
- ❌ Audio recording/playback
- ❌ Resume parsing enhancements
- ❌ Social features
- ❌ Mobile apps
- ❌ Advanced analytics
- ❌ Email notifications
- ❌ Password reset flow
- ❌ Enhanced feedback ($5 feature)

### Technical Debt
- ❌ PR workflow (using direct push)
- ❌ Comprehensive monitoring
- ❌ Perfect error messages
- ❌ 100% test coverage
- ❌ Performance optimization
- ❌ Google Live API naming fixes (if it works, ship it)

## 🎬 Code Hardening for Launch

### 1. Remove Mock Data (2 hours)
```bash
# Critical fixes only
- Remove [MOCK MODE] from session API
- Guard fallback database
- Update testimonials
```

### 2. Environment Validation (30 mins)
```typescript
// Add to app startup
const requiredEnvVars = [
  'GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY',
  'DATABASE_URL',
  'CLERK_SECRET_KEY',
  'STRIPE_SECRET_KEY'
];

requiredEnvVars.forEach(key => {
  if (!process.env[key]) {
    throw new Error(`Missing required: ${key}`);
  }
});
```

### 3. User-Facing Error Messages (1 hour)
```typescript
// Replace technical errors with friendly ones
catch (error) {
  if (error.message.includes('API key')) {
    return "Service temporarily unavailable. Please try again.";
  }
  return "Something went wrong. Please try again.";
}
```

### 4. Basic Rate Limiting (30 mins)
```typescript
// Simple in-memory rate limit
const attempts = new Map();
if (attempts.get(userId) > 10) {
  return "Too many requests. Please wait.";
}
```

## 📊 Launch Day Monitoring

### Critical Metrics Only
```bash
# 1. Are builds succeeding?
gcloud builds list --limit=5

# 2. Are users signing up?
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';

# 3. Are interviews working?
gcloud logging read "textPayload:\"interview\"" --limit=50

# 4. Are payments working?
# Check Stripe dashboard
```

### Alert Thresholds
- Build failures: Any
- Error rate: > 10%
- Response time: > 3s
- Payment failures: > 2

**Ship it when it works, perfect it when it's live!**

3. **Fix Fast**: Address only critical issues
4. **Re-deploy**: When stable
