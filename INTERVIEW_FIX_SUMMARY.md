# Interview Connection Fix Summary

## Issue
The interview was stuck in "connecting" state because the `/api/interview-v2/session/route.ts` endpoint was missing.

## Root Cause
The client code was trying to connect to a WebSocket endpoint that didn't exist. The hook was expecting `/api/interview-v2/session` to handle the connection, but only the health check endpoint existed.

## Fix Applied

1. **Created Missing Session Endpoint** (`/api/interview-v2/session/route.ts`)
   - POST endpoint to create a session
   - GET endpoint for Server-Sent Events (SSE) stream
   - Bridges client to Google Live API

2. **Updated Client Hook** (`useGenkitRealtime.ts`)
   - Changed from WebSocket to SSE (Next.js App Router doesn't support native WebSocket)
   - Two-step process: POST to create session, then connect to SSE stream
   - Updated error handling for SSE

3. **Created Dynamic Route** (`/api/interview-v2/session/[sessionId]/route.ts`)
   - PUT endpoint to send audio/text data from client to server

4. **Updated Session Manager**
   - Added fallback to check environment variables for local development
   - Better error handling for missing API key

## What Still Needs to be Done

1. **Configure Google AI API Key**
   ```bash
   # Add to .env.local
   GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=your_google_ai_api_key_here
   ```

2. **Test the Connection**
   - The interview should now progress past "connecting" state
   - Should receive a "ready" message from the server
   - AI should introduce itself and start the interview

## Technical Details

### Why SSE Instead of WebSocket?
- Next.js App Router doesn't support native WebSocket endpoints
- SSE provides similar functionality for server-to-client streaming
- Client sends data via HTTP PUT requests instead of WebSocket messages

### Architecture
```
Client (useGenkitRealtime) 
  ↓ POST (create session)
  ↓ GET (SSE stream)
Server (/api/interview-v2/session)
  ↓ WebSocket
Google Live API
```

### Error Messages Fixed
- "Cannot close a closed AudioContext" - Component remounting issue
- "sendData bypassed: status is not 'streaming' or 'connected'" - No backend to connect to

## Testing Steps

1. Set the Google AI API key in `.env.local`
2. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Navigate to the interview page
4. Click "Start Interview"
5. Should see:
   - Status change from "connecting" to "connected"
   - AI greeting message
   - Audio stream activation
